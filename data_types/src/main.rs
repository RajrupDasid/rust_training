    A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize these from other programming languages. Letâ€™s jump into how they work in Rust.

    Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays. */
    /*The Tuple Type

    A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

    We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple donâ€™t have to be the same. Weâ€™ve added optional type annotations in this example: */

    // println!(" The value of y is  {y}");
    // let five_hundred = tup.0;
    // println!("0 index value is {five_hundred}");
    // let flo = tup.1;
    // println!("index value of 1 will be {flo}");
    // let two = tup.2;
    // println!("{two}")
    /*
        This program creates the tuple x and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.

    The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written () and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they donâ€™t return any other value.
